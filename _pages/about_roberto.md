Dr. Roberto Souza is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Software Engineering at the University of Calgary, Canada, where he has been a faculty member since July 2020. Dr. Souza received his B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Pará (2012), and his M.Sc. (2014) and Ph.D. (2017) in Computer Engineering from the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil.

Before joining the University of Calgary as faculty, Dr. Souza completed three years of postdoctoral training in the Department of Radiology, where he worked closely with clinicians, medical physicists, and neuroscientists on clinically driven imaging problems. He also has international research experience as a visiting researcher and intern at the Grenoble Institute of Technology (France) and the University of Pennsylvania (USA).

Dr. Souza’s research lies at the intersection of medical image processing, machine learning, and data integration, with a particular focus on developing robust and data-efficient AI methods for medical imaging. His work spans image reconstruction, segmentation, and analysis, with applications in neuroimaging, oncology, and infant MRI. A recurring theme in his research is the development of hybrid and longitudinal learning approaches that integrate imaging data with prior knowledge or complementary clinical information to improve performance, interpretability, and clinical relevance.
