Dr. Mariana Bento is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Calgary, with a joint appointment
in the Department of Electrical and Software Engineering. Dr. Bento is a full member of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute and a recipient of funding from NSERC,
MITACS, NFRF, ALberta Innovates, among other funding agencies.

Dr. Bento received her B.Sc. in Teleinformatics Engineering from the Federal University of Ceará (2011), followed by M.Sc. (2013) and Ph.D. (2016) 
degrees in Computer Engineering from the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. Prior to her faculty appointment, she completed a postdoctoral 
fellowship in the Departments of Radiology and Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Calgary, where she worked on advanced neuroimaging and 
machine learning methods in close collaboration with clinicians and neuroscientists.

Her research focuses on Artificial Intelligence for healthcare, with particular emphasis on medical image processing and machine learning 
for aging and dementia. A central theme of Dr. Bento’s work is the development of responsible, trustworthy, and fair AI models, explicitly 
addressing bias, demographic variability, and heterogeneity arising from multi-site and multi-scanner data. She has led research on integrating
and aggregating large, heterogeneous, and multimodal datasets, improving model robustness, generalizability, and clinical translatability across 
institutions and populations.

Dr. Bento is also deeply committed to open science, developing and maintaining open-source neuroimaging tools and contributing to 
community-driven datasets and reproducible research practices. In parallel, she is actively engaged in equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) 
initiatives, including organizing and delivering workshops aimed at broadening participation and awareness in AI and medical imaging research.
