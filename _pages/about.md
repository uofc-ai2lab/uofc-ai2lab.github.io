We are the Advanced Imaging and Artificial Intelligence Lab (AI2Lab) located at the University of Calgary, one of the fastest-growing universities in Canada in terms of research output and located in one of the cities with best quality of life in the world. We are at the Electrical and Software Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering Departments of the [Schulich School of Engineering](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/). We are also affiliated with the [Hotchkiss Brain Institute](https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/), [McCaig Institute](https://mccaig.ucalgary.ca/), and [Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute](https://research4kids.ucalgary.ca/).

Our research is focused on the development of responsible AI for multimodal medical imaging applications. We are particularly intersted in studying brain and bone changes as we age and in the presence of disease. 

**Mission and Values**

1. Provide an equitable, diverse, inclusive, and accessible work environment to our trainees, making sure they will be well-positioned for success. If you think you are a good fit for our lab, we encourage you to reach out to us!

2. Develop high-impact research in the fields of imaging/image analysis and artificial intelligence. Most of our work involves images, but we also have other interests.

3. We are committed to open science. Whenever possible, we make our data and code publicly available. Our group is part of the Calgary-Campinas open science initiative. 

4. Give back to the community. As researchers, we feel that it is a duty to give back to the community. We organize free workshops on computer programming, image analysis and artificial intelligence. We strive to promote equity, diversity and inclusion in these workshops.
